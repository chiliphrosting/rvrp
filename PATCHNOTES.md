# PATCHNOTES

## 17APR25

This is a long time coming and something I pushed to the back burner was to optomize and further standardize updating [Reliable Virtual and Real Properties LLC website](https://reliablevirtualreal.com) both to improve the efficiency and quality of content delivery. A key area to further these processes is optomizing the development environment (system level) and enhancing the development tools where I spend a considerable amount of time investigating and testing, often leading me to side quests after side quests. One of the difficult parts was settling on a group of tools that wouldn't stray to far away from both my personal and career goals. I believe I am at the juncture out of tutorial hell and immersed in building and problem solving treading and navigating through piles of documenation, making sense of what it all means, and recording the progress. 

While these aren't promises to commit fully to keep a steady stream of updates to the website and I am also the owner of this company I make the website for as a result consumes a percentage of my time to operate, it does mean that critical milestones have been achieved.

<!-- Your new site is all yours so it doesn't matter if you break it! Try editing the code–add a button element that moves when the user clicks it.

In `index.html`, add this code on the line after the comment with `ADD BUTTON HERE` in it (you can copy and paste the button element HTML):

```html
<button>
    Click me!
</button>
```

Look at the page to see the button. Click it!

Open `script.js` to see the script that makes the button move.

## Keep going! 🚀

Try adding more properties to the CSS `dipped` style for the button to see how the changes appear on click.

- [x] Establish workable test build on local machine

**DERPRECIATED SECTION**

- [ ] List all variables, both constant and changing
	- [ ]: list variables
