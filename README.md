# DESCRIPTION

- The original designed came from [freehtml5.co](http://freehtml5.co/) and includes starter images from [unsplash](http://unsplash.com/).  
- The HTML and Javascript has been Refactored. 
	- None of the pictures from unsplash are hosted within the files instead are fetched from Google Drive. While this takes a hit in performance, it enables "on the fly" minor revisions to the pictures should they be needed.
- The website is hosted on GitHub but originally done so on glitch, which is why there are so many commits to the project and that it contains a number of external files. For the time being, the glitch project exists, however it will not be updated. Only the repo on GitHub will be.
