# DESCRIPTION

- The original design came from [freehtml5.co](http://freehtml5.co/) and includes starter images from [unsplash](http://unsplash.com/).  
- The HTML and Javascript has been refactored.  
	- The pictures from unsplash are part of the repo and pictures of the property are stored and published on Google Drive. When visiting the [reliablevirtualreal.com](https://reliablevirtualreal.com) website, getting the pictures from Google Drive does cause a performance hit. Alternatively, the setup enables "on the fly" revisions to the pictures should they be needed.
- The website is hosted on GitHub but originally it was on Glitch. Only this GitHub project is actively being updated.
